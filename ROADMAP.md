# Maintainer's roadmap

## Ideas

- New API to use regular atoms as ratoms: [#549](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/issues/546)
- Add React hook for using Ratoms/reactions through a hook: [#545](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/issues/545)
- Continue investigation if supporting React Fast Refresh through `defc` macro is possible
  [#598](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/pull/598)

## Released in 2.0

- Make Reagent React 18/19 and Concurrent Mode compatible
- Make functional components the default or remove the need for magic `:f>` syntax
    - Implemented with `defc` macro
