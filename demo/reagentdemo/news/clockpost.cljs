         makes sure that only the parts of the DOM that actually need
         to change are updated. For example, the "
          [:code "column-pair"] " function corresponding to hours only
         runs once every hour."]

         [:p "And that’s what makes Reagent and React fast. Try
         clicking on the clock to toggle the display of 1/100th
         seconds. Most browsers should have no trouble at all keeping
         up (even if they won’t actually show every 1/100th second:
         they are typically limited to roughly 60 fps)."]

         [:p "But it is a very handy illusion. Almost the entire UI is
         made up of pure functions, transforming immutable data into
         other immutable data structures. That makes them easy to
         reason about, and trivial to test. You don’t have to care
         about ”model objects”, or about how to update the DOM
         efficiently. "]

         [:p "Just pass arguments to component functions, return a UI
         description that corresponds to those arguments, and leave it
         to React to actually display that UI."]])]]))
