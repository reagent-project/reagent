       [:p new-in-alpha "Reagent has another way of isolating part of
       a data structure in an atom: " [:code "reagent.core/cursor"] ".

       atoms (or other cursors). If the cursor is used in a component
       the getter function will re-run to change the value of the

       [:h2 "Values and references"]

       [:p "So what’s the difference between wraps and cursors? Why
       have both?"]

       [:p "A " [:code "wrap"] " is just a value that happens to look
       like an " [:code "atom"] ". It doesn’t change unless you tell
       it to. It is a very lightweight combination of value and a
       callback to back-propagate changes to the value. It relies only
       on Reagent’s equality test
       in " [:code ":should-component-update"] " to avoid unnecessary
       re-rendering."]

       [:p "A " [:code "cursor"] ", on the other hand, will always be
       up-to-date with the value of the source atom. In other words,
       it acts a reference to part of the value of the source.
       Components that " [:code "deref"] " cursors are re-rendered
       automatically, in exactly the same way as if
       they " [:code "deref"] " a normal Reagent atom (unnecessary
       re-rendering is avoided by checking if the cursor's value has
       changed using " [:code "identical?"] ")."]


       [:h2 "Faster rendering"]

       [:p "Reagent used to wrap all ”native” React components in an
       extra Reagent component, in order to keep track of how deep in
       the component tree each component was (to make sure that
       un-necessary re-renderings were avoided)."]

       [:p "Now, this extra wrapper-component isn’t needed anymore,
       which means quite a bit faster generation of native React
       elements. This will be noticeable if you generate html strings,
       or if you animate a large number of components."]


       [:h2 "Simple React integration"]

       [:p "Since Reagent doesn't need those wrappers anymore it is
       also now easier to mix native React components with Reagent
       ones. There’s a new convenience
       function, " [:code "reagent.core/create-element"] ", that
       simply calls " [:a {:href
       cel-link} [:code "React.createElement"]] ". This,
       unsurprisingly, creates React elements, either from the result
       of " [:code "React.createClass"] " or html tag names."]

       [:p [:code "reagent.core/as-element"] " turns Reagent’s hiccup
       forms into React elements, that can be passed to ordinary React
