# Example of using [ReactMde](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde) with Reagent.

This example shows how we can use [react-mde](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde) with
reagent, taking into account the needed fix for the `textarea` component used by `react-mde`.

This example is very similar to the `material-ui` example, but also requires the usage of
`forwardRef` with the custom textarea component.


### Running

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
