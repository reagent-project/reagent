    ;; But repositioning the cursor within the text, turns out to
    ;; be quite a challenge because changes in the text can be
    ;; triggered by various events like:
    ;; - a validation function rejecting a user inputted char
    ;; - the user enters a lower case char, but is transformed to
    ;;   upper.
    ;; - the user selects multiple chars and deletes text
    ;; - the user pastes in multiple chars, and some of them are
    ;;   rejected by a validator.
    ;; - the user selects multiple chars and then types in a
    ;;   single new char to repalce them all.

    ;; been easy ALTHOUGH in the end, it kinda fell out nicely,
