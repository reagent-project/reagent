    ... @c ;; equivalent to (get-in @ra [:nested :content])

    ... (swap! c inc) ;; equivalence to (swap! ra update-in [:nested :content] inc)

  something like this:

  ```cljs
  (defn set-get
    ([k] (get-in @state k))
    ([k v] (swap! state assoc-in k v)))
  ```

  The function will be called with one argument – the path passed to
  cursor – when the cursor is deref'ed, and two arguments (path and
  new value) when the cursor is modified.

  Given that set-get function, (and that state is a Reagent atom, or
  another cursor) these cursors are equivalent:
  `(cursor state [:foo])` and `(cursor set-get [:foo])`.

  Note that a cursor is lazy: its value will not change until it is
  used. This may be noticed with add-watch."
